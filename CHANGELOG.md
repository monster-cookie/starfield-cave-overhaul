# Venpi's Cave Overhaul

## Version 1.0.1 (BETA)
* Added new terrormorph elder controller fun cave (1 controller, 3 humans, 2 robots, and 3 predators) for a fun multi-way battle until the elder takes over everyone. 
* Added 3 more creature caves
* Remain caves I think I might have found the real bug and testing the fix of adding CCT_Enviro_Underground [KYWD:001122A6] to the cave's location record

## Version 1.0.0 (BETA)
* Initial Release
* The open world caves will now spawn enemies without having to be in a random encounter quest
