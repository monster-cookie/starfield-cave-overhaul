    Subject: Exploration and Seizure of Intergalactic Portals


    Greetings,


    Effective immediately, all platoons are ordered to engage in a systematic exploration of their assigned sectors with the primary objective of identifying, securing, and reporting any Portals found on planets within these sectors. These Portals, believed to be gateways to distant galaxies and realms, are of immense strategic importance. Your mission is to locate these Portals, assess their stability and operational status, and secure them against any potential threats or unauthorized access. Utmost discretion and tactical expertise are required in handling these sensitive sites.


    Upon discovery of a Portal, platoon leaders are to establish a secure perimeter and immediately report the findings to Command Center using the secure StellarCom network. Detailed reports on the Portal's location, structural integrity, and any encountered resistance are mandatory. Ecliptic Command will provide further instructions on stabilization and integration procedures. Remember, this mission not only requires strength but also a profound sense of curiosity and adaptability. The discovery and control of these Portals could reshape our understanding of the universe and our place in it. Ecliptic Command counts on your bravery and expertise to lead this critical mission.


    End Transmission.


    Ecliptic Command, United Galactic Forces
